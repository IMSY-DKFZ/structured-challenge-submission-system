            These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of the MICCAI
            submission tool for biomedical challenges. By accessing this website we assume that you
            accept these terms and conditions in full. Do not register to the website if you do not
            accept all of the terms and conditions stated on this page.

          <h4>1. Purpose of data collection, processing and use</h4>
          <p>
            The purpose of the website is to create, submit, review and register proposals for
            biomedical challenges as part of the International Conference on medical Image Computing
            and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2023. For a proposal to be accepted, it must
            first be reviewed by several reviewers (see 2. Disclosure to third parties). If a
            proposal is rejected, the challenge will not be part of the MICCAI 2024 satellite event
            program. An organizer of a challenge can create challenge proposals by filling in
            challenge design parameters. We refer to these data as challenge proposal data. Before
            registration, please read and accept the data protection policy.

          <h4>2. Disclosure to third parties</h4>
          <p>
            Users with the 'administrator' or 'sub-administrator' role get an overview of the
            following personal data: Username, email address and, if specified, full name and
            institution. In addition, an administrator can observe but not change your challenge
            proposals. The developers of the website (staff of the Division of Computer Assisted
            Medical Interventions of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)) and members of the
            DKFZ IT core facility, the MICCAI 2024 organizing committee and the MICCAI board are/may
            be assigned the role 'administrator' or 'sub-administrator' and can potentially see the
            data described above. We will refer to these users as administrators or
            sub-administrators in the remainder of the text. Users with role 'reviewer' or
            'meta-reviewer' can review and comment on your challenge proposals. They have no access
            to your personal data. The administrators may use the challenge proposal data for
            experiments and quantitative, qualitative and statistical analyses. In case a challenge
            will be accepted, the challenge proposal data will be uploaded and publicly visible as
            pdf documents along with the challenge registration process, which allows for structured
            access to information on past MICCAI challenges.
